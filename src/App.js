// # React State: Counter

// In the `./src/App.js` you'll find the basic building blocks of a counter.

// The general idea here is that the counter should count up when the plus button is
//clicked, and count down when the minus button is clicked.

// Currently, the value `0` is hardcoded and doesn't respond to the buttons being
//clicked.

// ## Task

// Refactor the code so that it features React state and makes use of it. Declare
//a state variable and make sure to have the buttons update said state variable.

// You can use the following hints as a guideline:

// - `let` doesn't seem to be the appropriate way to declare a variable in this
//instance.
// - Is there a built-in React function you can use instead?
//   - Make sure to import said function.
// - At present, the `<button>`s' event handler is logging an emoji to the console.
//   - Clearly, the event handler should be handling a different type of functionality.
